# Components

This library contains UI components and themes.

## How components are developed

Start the app using `yarn android:storybook` or `yarn ios:storybook` to launch the Storybook UI. Once a new component has been added in the lib, ensure that an accompanying "componentName.stories.tsx" file is created that registers it in the Storybook UI.
